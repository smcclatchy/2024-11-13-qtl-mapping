This course introduces genetic mapping using qtl2, a R package for analyzing quantitative
phenotypes and genetic data from complex crosses like the Diversity Outbred (DO).
Genetic mapping with qtl2 allows researchers in fields as diverse as medicine, evolution,
and agriculture to identify specific chromosomal regions that contribute to variation in
phenotypes (quantitative trait loci or QTL). The goal is to identify the action,
interaction, number, and precise location of these regions. The course concludes with a
complete analytical workflow from a study of DO mice. The lesson is adapted from
